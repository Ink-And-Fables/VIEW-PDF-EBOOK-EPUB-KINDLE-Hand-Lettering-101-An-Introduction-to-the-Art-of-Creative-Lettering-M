Title: Preety Book with NO usable content!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2018
Review: To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. This is the first book on hand lettering I had purchased and it is a pretty book, sure for the counter-top, not what I was looking for. I am new to hand lettering and I LOVE IT!! The most important thing for a newcomer and every Blog out there will back me up - probably even the author of this book, though she neglected to even mention these points in her beginners book- and that is the six basic stokes. These stokes are all I worked on for the first month of practice until I advanced to whole letters. The reason is the necessity of building muscle memory while writing the letters, until it becomes routine (I am not there yet lol) Using the basic strokes you can write 98% of the entire alphabet. There are few stokes outside of them, yet sadly these are not even brought up in this book on beginning hand lettering.

This author did not even mention the existence of the basic stokes, her book is basically only some practice pages where you are given 4 inches to practice each letter in the alphabet. That's it. Then she talks a bit about placement of letters when writing quotes... really nothing to grab hold of and to learn this new skill. But it is a pretty book. I returned the book as I was not looking, not could I afford for a coffee table book. I felt obligated to record my findings for my fellow amazon-customer peers. If you are looking for a great book I found this one: Brush Pen Lettering: A Step-by-Step Workbook for Learning Decorative Scripts and Creating Inspired Styles. It can be found at this link just copy the link and paste it into the web browser address.

Truly an encompassing work that has taught me SO MUCH, more than I ever dared hope could be found in hand lettering! It is very exciting! (I get nothing for the recommendation it is purely by my own desire that I add this information.)
Good Luck Beginning Hand Letterers!!

Title: Hand Lettering Made Simple
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018
Review: First of all, lets start off with how cute this spotted book is. It has these gorgeous gold trims on the corners that look so fancy I quite honestly don't want to even write in it. I love learning calligraphy on my iPad so I actually scanned them into my iPad so that I can practice forever without having to damage my book. You guys have no idea how cute it is!! Maybe one day when I find the pretty calligraphy pens I will get the nerve to actually write inside of it. For now I'll just keep on practicing on my iPad. I kept searching everywhere and all of the calligraphy books were so darn expensive-- literally hundreds of dollars to learn. I carry the book in my purse (book bag) everywhere I go and practice every chance I get. I cannot believe how easy ChalkFullofLove makes this look. I have actually gotten up the nerve to try my own hand at calligraphy and create things for my home. The book starts off with the basics from lowercase, to capitals and even numbers and works it's way to different strokes and actually creating full art pieces. For less than $20 you can try your hand at calligraphy and it's so much fun... not to mention relaxing! I put up a photo of the pretty cover and one of the evolution of designs to show you how she goes from simple to intricate. I also posted a photo so you can see one of the creations I made from practicing. I practice any chance I get and I love it. I hope that you do too! Don't wait...get your copy as soon as possible. I cannot wait to get hand lettering 201.

Title: Love it extra fonts included great for beginners
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2018
Review: Love it! It took me about 7-8 hours of practice to learn how to flourish my letters I am getting pretty good at it. Great for beginners and I love the extra fonts they teach. The elements are so cute. You don‚Äôt need any special pens I use all different types. The smoothest lines are created by a normal size sharpie. But practicing with regular pens will save you money.

Title: In LOVE with this book!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2018
Review: Not only is this introductory book beautifully put together, the author helps you to build you‚Äôre own beautiful style! She provides easy to follow guides and plenty of room to practice. Overall, she provides the tools a new hand lettering artist needs in their toolbox and references for different alphabet styles that I continuously look at to practice lettering. I‚Äôve been practicing lettering for awhile and have picked up a couple books here and there to practice with, but this book really took my hand lettering to the next level physically and with confidence. I also really appreciate that the author used good quality paper to practice on as I‚Äôve used other books with poor quality paper that has ruined some of my pens. Definitely recommend this to any and especially new hand letterers!

Review: After researching many blogs and instagrams looking for an informative and relaxing way to learn lettering, I decided to go with Hand Lettering 101 and couldn‚Äôt be more happy. Sarah‚Äôs direction is amazingly effective and fun way to learn - after the first few chapters I was surprised with how my writing improved. She‚Äôs also amazing to follow on Instagram and provides inspiration to put your new skill to use!

Title: On the fence!

Review: I‚Äôm on the fence with this book. # 1 issues is there are no uppercase letter tutorials! That‚Äôs in the second book... #2 issue is there was some horrible editing of this beautiful book. Lots of mistakes, typos. Besides that it‚Äôs a great beginner book...her technique isn‚Äôt what I really wanted, I needed a book what was more for brush lettering and hers is what I would call faux lettering, she makes her letters thick by going back and filling in - very time consuming....

Title: I love this book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2016
Review: I love this book. I used to practice watching tutorials but having this book makes a world of a difference. It is a beautiful book that includes the entire alphabet and space to trace them and practice them. It shows you how to connect letters and even make them dance! I love this book. I recommend this to beginners and people that are trying to better their technique.
